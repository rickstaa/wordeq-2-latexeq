# Wordeq-2-latexeq

Small Javascript Regex app that converts Word equations to Latex equations. I quickly created this app when I encountered problems copying equations from word to latex. For more information see [this StackOverflow question](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/645334/mathbit-undefined-control-sequence). It uses regex to remove the following redundant tags that are added by word:

-   `\mathbit`
-   `\mathbf`

Feel free to open a [pull request](https://github.com/rickstaa/wordeq-2-latexeq/pulls) if you think a tag is missing or want to improve the app styling ðŸ–Œ. Please check out the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines for more information on how to contribute.
